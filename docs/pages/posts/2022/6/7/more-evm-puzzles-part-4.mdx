Yes, that's right, I solved it immediately without reading by simply pressing enter on accident. What the heck just happened here?

```plaintext
00      34        CALLVALUE        [0]
01      15        ISZERO           [1]
02      19        NOT              [0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffe]
03      6007      PUSH1 07         [0x07, 0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffe]
05      57        JUMPI            []
06      FD        REVERT
07      5B        JUMPDEST         []
```

Right at the start it checks whether the call value sent is zero, which is strange since we were never given a chance to specify it.. Anyway, the result of this check is then inverted with `NOT`. Note that inverting a number 1 of type uint256 flips all of its bits, that means it doesn't turn into 0 but into the biggest number possible minus one. Since `JUMPI` jumps for any value different from 0, it would've jumped no matter which value we'd have sent since any non-zero value would have resulted in `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` after the inversion. So it seems we can just completely ignore this part...

20      F1        CALL             [SUCCESS, 0, ADDRESS]
21      6001      PUSH1 01         [1, SUCCESS, 0, ADDRESS]
23      14        EQ               [1, 0, ADDRESS]
24      6028      PUSH1 28         [0x28, 1, 0, ADDRESS]
26      57        JUMPI            [0, ADDRESS]

```

We sent no calldata but it'll still attempt copying it to memory here. Then it'll deploy that empty calldata as initialization bytecode which doesn't return anything, so basically we're successfully deploying an empty contract. This contract is then immediately called. The puzzle obtains its own account balance using the `SELFBALANCE` opcode which is used for the first time here, and it would send all of this balance during the call if it had any. As things stand, this is a call made against an address that contains empty bytecode and the call succeeds. You shouldn't be surprised by that, after all we already know that we don't have to write `STOP` at the end of a contract. So an empty contract is just like a contract that has a single `STOP` instruction.

Furthermore, we can even send invalid calldata that'll result in the `CREATE` opcode to fail and return the zero-address. Calls made to the zero-address will also succeed without reverting since it too has empty bytecode, like any uninitialized address. It's actually harder to fail this puzzle than to win it since we'd have to make the call fail by deploying runtime bytecode that'll revert.

```plaintext
29      47        SELFBALANCE      [0, 0, ADDRESS]
2A      14        EQ               [1, ADDRESS]
2B      602F      PUSH1 2F         [0x2F, 1, ADDRESS]
2D      57        JUMPI            [ADDRESS]
2E      FD        REVERT
2F      5B        JUMPDEST         [ADDRESS]
30      00        STOP             [ADDRESS]
```

Finally, it checks whether the `SELFBALANCE` after the successful call is the same as the balance was before the call.

So what was actually supposed to happen here? I think the first part was supposed to ensure that value must have been sent to the puzzle. Then all of this value would have been sent to the contract created using the specified calldata. This contract would have needed to send all of this value back to the puzzle contract to pass the final check. But it wouldn't have been able to do that via the `CALL` opcode since that would execute the puzzle code again which would send it away to another contract it created. Instead, the contract we created via calldata would've had to use the `SELFDESTRUCT` opcode to inject the value back into the puzzle during the call.

The key takeaway here is that although uint256 are used as booleans by the EVM (0 is false, non-0 is true) doesn't mean that inverting it via `NOT` opcode will result in flipping the boolean, rather than that it'll flip every single byte in the uint256, and that is something that can be easily missed!

## Puzzle #9

```plaintext

03      52        MSTORE
04      6020      PUSH1 20
06      6000      PUSH1 00

09      60F8      PUSH1 F8
0B      1C        SHR
0C      60A8      PUSH1 A8
0E      14        EQ
0F      6016      PUSH1 16
11      57        JUMPI
12      FD        REVERT
13      FD        REVERT
14      FD        REVERT
15      FD        REVERT
16      5B        JUMPDEST
17      00        STOP

? Enter the value to send:
```

Right away, we're storing the `CALLVALUE` we send to offset `0x0` in memory. Then 2 new opcodes are introduced:

You've probably heard about `SHA3` before. It's a one-way hashing algorithm, the EVM makes this algorithm available to us via this instruction and passes it the data to hash via memory. Two items will be consumed from stack: The "offset" specifying where it should begin hashing the data and the "size" telling it when to stop. The resulting 256 bit long hash will be pushed as a new item onto the stack. Here, we'll always be hashing the first memory slot, which are the first 32 bytes (`0x20`).

The `SHR` opcode stands for SHift Right, and that's exactly what it does on the bit level. It too consumes two items from the stack: The number of times to shift right and the value that should be shifted. For example, if the first item would be a 2 and the second a 17 (`00010001`), the result would be 4 (`00000100`). In case of this puzzle, we're always shifting 248 (`0xF8`) times and the value being shifted is the SHA-3 hash that was calculated just before.

In case of the stack, we're shifting a value with 256 bits though: `256 - 248` is 8, and that means that everything except the first byte (most-left, or highest order) of the hash is shifted into nothingness. Finally the usual comparison and jump: Only if this byte is equal to `0xA8` the puzzle is solved!

In summary: We need to find an integer value to send whose hash starts with `0xA8`.

Since hashing algorithms are one-way functions, there's no way to say which values will produce it without guessing. Luckily it's only about the first byte, and that should be pretty easy to stumble upon even when just continuously increasing the value by one.

So what's the laziest way to do this? A shellscript! Don't judge me, it works and it only took me a couple minutes:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
COUNTER=1
rm solutions/solution_9.json
while [ $? == 1 ]
do
     printf "$COUNTER\nn\n" | npx hardhat play
     COUNTER=$[$COUNTER +1]
     rm solutions/solution_9.json
done
```

Granted, it's not performant what so ever, but I didn't expect it to be a high number anyway, and it wasn't. It was 47, which is `0xa813484aef6fb598f9f753daf162068ff39ccea4075cb95e1a30f86995b5b7ee` and `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a8` after being shifted right.

```
? Enter the value to send: 47

Puzzle solved!

? Enter the calldata:
```

Right at the beginning, the first 32 bytes (`0x20`) from calldata are copied to the first memory slot, where it's immediately read from again using `MLOAD`. Afterwards, a bitwise `AND` is applied to it with `0xF0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0`. This means that only the upper 4 bits of each byte from the first 32 bytes we sent as calldata are still there. The lower 4 bits have been "masked" out and the result is left on the top of the stack.

The next 32 bytes from calldata are now copied to memory overwriting the first ones. This word of bytes is again loaded onto stack like before with `MLOAD` and then `OR`ed with the result of the `AND` operation. The `JUMPI` condition to solve the puzzle is that the result of these operations ends up being equal to `0xABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABAB`.

If we call the first word from calldata A and the second word B, the following is the "formula" we have to solve here:

```
(A & 0xF0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0) | B = 0xABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABAB
```

If we send zeros for A the result of the `AND` operation will be a zero-word too. That way we can discard A completely and just send the end result as B:

```
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 | B = 0xABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABAB
```

Putting the words together as a single calldata, this is indeed a solution:

```
? Enter the calldata: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABAB

Puzzle solved!
```

But bit-masking is an interesting thing to understand: If we had sent `0xAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA` as A, it would've ended up as `0xA0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0A0` after the `AND` operation masked out the lower bits. Then we could've sent `0x0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B` as B which, `OR`ed with A, would've produced the desired result too:

```
? Enter the calldata: 0xAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B0B
